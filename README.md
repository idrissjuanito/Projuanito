## Vanilla JS only

This the first version i built for the site. Did not use any dependencies or any know worklow technique. just went a head did everything from scratch with beginner knowledge of JS. 

## Plans

I intend to make this completely serverless application using the JAMstack architecture. Will have some dependencies and probably use web components and modules to reorganize the code.
